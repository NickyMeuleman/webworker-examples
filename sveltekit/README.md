## Run locally

Run these commands in a terminal:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

## Older projects

In Vite v2, using the standard syntax in combination with SSR is not supported.
For those projects, use the `?worker` import syntax.
See [this example usage](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/webworker-examples/blob/7969062a81bdaca3e1fbce389dc4799388b9b614/sveltekit/src/routes/index.svelte).
